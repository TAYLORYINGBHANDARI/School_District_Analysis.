# School_District_Analysis.

* Use Python and Pandas library to analyze school distrct data and showcase trends in school analysis
* Use Jupyter Notebook to visualize data outcomes as table format.

## Overview 

The school board has discovered the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; especifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. In order to uphold the standards, Maria would like us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
And then perform an analysis to compare the changes and how the overall analysis gets affected. 

### completing tasks:

    1. Replace reading and math scores to NaNs for Thomas High School ninth grade.
    2. Repeat the district summary
    3. Repeat the school summary
    4. Finding the new top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    5. Findng the new average math score for each grade level from each school
    6. Finding the new average reading score for each grade level from each school
    7. Finding the new scores by school spending per student.
    8. Finding the new scores by school spending by school size.
    9. Finding the new scores by school spending by school type
